# Mobility-Justice-Tool

The ‘Mobility Justice Tool’ is a piece of software designed to help the federal government find the best location for asylum centres. 
You can use the software to calculate the best location within a region, for example, or you can click through the map yourself and check how good a self-selected location is.
This is calculated on the basis of proximity to various services that are important for asylum seekers. For example, bus stops, schools, shopping facilities, hospitals or German courses. 

Inspired by the wonderful and important book "Mobility Justice: The Politics of Movement in An Age of Extremes" by Mimi Sheller.
